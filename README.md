Browser start page
# First Browser Start Page
I created a simple and minimalistic broswer start page that links to 4 of my most visted sites. I had fun creating this page and learned quite a bit after some trial and error.

# Features:
	Functional Clock
	Current weather based on geolocation 
	DuckDuckGp search bar
