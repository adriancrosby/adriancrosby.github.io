      <br>
      <p>Halfpipe Cannabis is the easy-on-the-wallet flower brand designed to match your California lifestyle. We handpick the best genetics to thrive in our native coastal region to deliver the highest quality buds. Every flower is meticulously cared for by our devoted team and grown in a state-of-the-art greenhouse located on the sunny coast of California for a consistency you can count on.
      <br>
      <br>
      Our manufacturing process consists of premium biomass extracted with cryogenically chilled ethanol to provide the cleanest product from start to finish. After extraction, we complete a triple distillation to ensure our customers receive the highest quality, consistent, and potent product – a final oil with a high THC concentrate that provides the full flavor of the terpenes and oil.
